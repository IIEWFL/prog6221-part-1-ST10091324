# This project is about a recipe maker
The main goal is to have a fully functional graphic user interface that will allow the user to:
- Add ingredient names
- Add ingredient quantities
- Add ingredient measurements
- Add steps to make the recipe
- Display those ingredient values and steps
- Remove ingredients
- Increase quantities of ingredients and much more

The user will be able to perform more functions as the project evolves.
The project is written in C# and is currently limited to the command line.
For a deeper dive into the functionality of the project, have a look at the code.
