#This project is about a recipe maker
the main goal is to have a fully functional graphic user interface that will allow the user to:
- add ingredient names
- add ingredient quantities
- add ingredient measurements
- add steps to make the recipe
- display those ingredient values and steps
- remove ingredients
- increase quantities of ingredients and much more

the user will be able to perform more functions as the project evolves
the project is written in C# and is currently limited to the command line
for a deeper dive into the functionality of the project, have a look at the code
